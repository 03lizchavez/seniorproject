# seniorproject
This project'll take course over the entire Spring 2025 semester. This project will include a website discussing life in NYC and the working class
as current times have such controversy. This website will include every borough in NYC and will show each incident where there may have been discrimination or a crime being committed. Moreso for the website's focus, since NYC is such a highly populated area that it needs to be narrowed down, the main focus will be street vendors in NYC and their everyday struggle.
