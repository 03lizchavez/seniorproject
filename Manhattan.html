        <h2>Chinatown, Canal St</h2>
        <h3>Chinatown was raided by police on January 6, 2025 according to Dean Moses from AMNY news article. The first image used to introduce the
        topic of vendors and the current crackdowns NYC has been undergoing was an officer smiling while holding a detained person while another cop had
        their back to the camera. AMNY is high in factual reporting and with a left-center bias. However with the information provided, it seems
        to be a very opinionated article and failed to keep the topic neutral. Many negative reasons were listed which can lead to the readers to believe
        that this crucial topic is as direct as the way the article described and vendors are the problem.

        <h3>This clip was posted by FOX 5 New York. FOX 5 New York is known to not be biased and high in factual reporting. This clip includes vendors
        speaking back on the matters and how they feel about the issue. The clip of the video takes place around City Hall for the protests supporting vendors rights. It also includes
        multiple clips from vendors throughout all the boroughs and police confronting them at their shop. There are many stories to hear and life
        is not in black and white. We all have an opinion and to live in a world where we are expected to all agree is absurd. However, we know when 
        something wrong and immoral being done is unacceptable. Many people argue about the law and how rules should be followed, yet, rules are always
        being changed. If they were, we wouldn't have progressed as far as we have. So why not use our voice, our freedom of speech, to amplify what these victims
        have been shouting for so long before.

        <h2>Broadway</h2>

        <h3>The main issue listed here was that local business aren't benefiting from this and the blame is to the street vendors. As shown before,
        vendors set up shop on busy streets/places to be able to drum up business for their small business to be able to make a living. The businesses
        they set up shop outside of, tend to be large corporate department stores like Gucci and YSL. Their main concern is "'He or she will look at the property and say,
        "'This is this is not authentic. This is a knockoff bag. This is a fake pair of sneakers.' And that point, we make the arrest,' Maddrey said.". Maddrey
        was the NYPD Chief who had something to say in response to many voicing their opinion on the matter as they watched the evnts unfold before them.
        Newsflash, everyone knows the items being sold off the street are not legitimate. Yet many people also buy it because they don't want to spend more
        on an item with the brand logo compared</h3>
