        <h1><b><i>Brief Information</i></b></h1>
        <h4>Not many people may know what goes on in other cities/states outside of where they're from. Though the people
            themselves aren't 100% to blame. I'm a student from New York City at Penn State Behrend. Being here has made me realize
        how sheltered many people may be and don't focus on social issues until brought up. The current issue, which may not be an Erie
        problem, is an issue dealt with in many highly populated urban areas. Many street vendors are being mistreated and are being
        stripped of their main source of income. This website here will be set to inform the audience with all the reports I can find
        and locations of protests including their purpose. <!--Possibly make this a website to be able to recieve news throughout the country
        and outside this country.--></h4>
        <h3>Fear from Street Vendors</h3>
        <h4>
            <!-- <link href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/02/19/street-vendors-selling-food-from-home-amid-ice-fears">-->
            Many vendors are afraid to set up shop at their normal spots because of the police raids crackdown all throughout the city. The 
            city contains 5 boroughs and called "home" to almost 8 million people. There are many popular places, especially spots visited frequently
            by tourists, that are practically owned by street vendors, yet the competition is getting fiercer as more vendors pop up, causing an 
            increase in competition. Because of that increase, many people have come to complain about it, causing crack downs. However, because of raids,
            they lose business and their main form of income. The treatment that they receive is something that needs to be changed. There's many
            controversy about this topic that'll be further discussed and more infornation provided for each borough.
